# Workshops

This repository contains the workshops that I have conducted.

Some of them are affiliated with the organization **Machine Learning and Data Analytics Laboratory (MLDA@EEE)**, of which I was an academic trainer.

For a better learning experience, please follow along the slides to check at which stage the coding sessions / demos / hands-on were introduced to the live audience.
